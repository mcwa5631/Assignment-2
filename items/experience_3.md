My third favourite experience was traveling was going on vacation to Jamaica with my family and some family friends. We took a trip to Jamaica for a week at a family friends villa in Montego Bay. We went on this trip in August of 2023. I really enjoyed the openess of the vacation as usually we stay at a resort however since it was at a friends villa, we had lots of freedom to do what we want and spend time together. I don't get to see these family friends often so it was great to spend so much time with them. My favourite experience was our first dinner we had when we had arrived, a large dinner was waiting for us with lots of food that I had never tried before, fresh from the garden and ocean. I did not enjoy getting sunburnt everyday, as it was peak summer at the time, the temperature was not what I was used to in Canada and we had spent a majority of our time outside. I would give this experience an A+ since it was a vacation like no other I have had before.
