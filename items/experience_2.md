Another one of my favourite experiences was winning the BTM case hack competition in my first year of university. I was on a team with 3 other students in order to break down a case and propose improvements to the companies issues. I did this during the winter semester of first year university so around February 2024. My favourite memeory was going into the presenattion room to present our solutions to the judges as it felt like a proper prosseional presentation and was a culmination of all the work we had done in the last 24 hours. I did not enjoy having to keep re-evaluating our plan because of issues we had found in the case or complications presented with our solutions. This took a lot of problem solving on our end. I would give this experience an A since we had won the competition.
