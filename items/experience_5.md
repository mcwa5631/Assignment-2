My final favourite experience was going to Ottawa for AA Basebal provincial playoffs this past summer. My team had made it to provincials in the summer after a long season of 25+ games and 3 tournaments. We had many early morning and late night practices throughout the season. This was during the first week of August 2024. It was great to spend time with my Baseball team overnight and play lots during a short period of time. I also enjoy the competiveness of tournaments espeically ones that mean so much. My favourite memory was finding out we had made it to the finals, where we had to return back to Toronto for the finals after a long day of rainouts on Sunday. I did not enjoy waiting around all of Sunday to find out we wouldn't b playing at all since it felt like an obvious waste of time to me when we could have been going back home, which was a 4 hour drive back, I had wanted to leave earlier when it seemed like we would not play at all. I would give this experience a B.
