In the summer of 2024 I worked as a intern at a company called AlertDriving. I was interning as a sales trategy analsyt. My job was to track companies compliance and collisions who bought dirver fleet training from us. I would use Excel to track this data and create presentations on keynote to exaplin to customers why our program was effective for them. It was during the summer of 2024 after my first year of university from May to August. It was my first opprotunity to work in a professional work enviorment. It was great to be able to learn how to implement tools like Excel, which we learn a lot about in school, in a work enviorment and see how effective it can be. My favuorite memory was presenting the statistics I found and data I had found interesting and showing the customer how they can get more out of our services. I did not enjoy communting to the office everyday since my school schedule was much mroe dynamic than my work schedule which was from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm. I would rate ths experience an A.
