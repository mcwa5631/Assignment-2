A key experience for me 2 years ago was finding out that I had been accepted into the BTM program at Laurier. It had felt good to be rewarded for my hardwork during the last couple years of highschool. As soon as I had received the acceptance email, I had called bth my parents to tell them the exciting news! This was in November of 2022 so very early into 12th grade of highschool. It was great to have the relief of knowing that not only I was able to go to university somewhere, but it was also one of my top choices for where I wanted to go to school. My favourite memory of it was calling my parents to tell them the exiciting news as they had known how hard I had been trying in school and what it had meant to me. There was nothing that I did not enjoy about this experience. I would give this experience an A as well because of the early timing of it, it gave me assurance for the rest of the school year.
